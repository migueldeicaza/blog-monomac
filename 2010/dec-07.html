	Coding</a> is a set of practices that allow applications to
	access object properties using strings.  This is similar
	to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc189022(VS.95).aspx">Binding
	Expressions</a> in Silverlight.  In both cases the purpose is
	to allow tooling that does not directly have access to your
	native code to access properties from your program.

	<p>You would typically use this from a tool like Interface
	Builder, where you can use the Binding Inspector (âŒ˜4 from
	Interface Builder) to explore the possible values of the
	component that you can data bind.  In Interface Builder you
	would use string to describe the name of the property that you
	want to access.  For example, consider the options available
	for the NSPopUpButton component show on the right.  All of
	those properties of the NSPopUpButton can be pulled directly
	from your code from Interface Builder without having to
	manually hook things up.

	<p>To use this with MonoMac, all you have to do is make sure
	that any property that you want to access from Interface
	Builder is flagged with the [Export] attribute.  If you apply
	the Export attribute without any parameters, it will expose
	the C# name of your property for Key-Value access.  You can
	change the name that is exposed by passing a parameter, for
	example: [Export ("myIndex")].

	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mono/monomac/tree/master/samples/QTRecorder">QTRecorder sample</a> shows how various elements in the UI are connected to the code:

	<p><a href="http://monomac.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/props.png"><img class="alignleft
	size-medium wp-image-36" title="props"
	src="http://monomac.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/props.png?w=169"
	alt="" width="169" height="300" /></a>In that sample, the
	class QTRecorder, a class derived from NSDocument exposes
	properties that are hooked up directly to the Enabled
	properties in various buttons in the UI and properties to
	populate and control the contents of the various popups in the
	application.  All of these bindings are configured by setting
	the target of the binding to be the "File's Owner", in this
	case the QTRecorder class, as it happens to load the
	QTRecorder.nib file.  You can see the complete list of
	bindings in the screenshot on the left.

	<p>Let us explore what happens in the application.  The Video
	Devices popup is controlled through three bindings: the
	Content, the Content Values and the Selected Object.  This is
	what the binding are configured to in Interface Builder for
	all three properties:

	<p><a href="http://monomac.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/binding2.png"><img class="alignnone
	size-full wp-image-41" title="binding"
	src="http://monomac.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/binding2.png"
	alt="" width="640" height="105" /></a>

	<p>The <strong>Content</strong> is bound to the VideoDevices
	property in the source code, this is a property that merely
	returns the strongly typed QTCaptureDevice array of the
	available devices.  The <strong>Content Values </strong>is
	bound to the VideoDevices.localizedDisplayName.  The first
	part of the key matches our VideDevices array, and the second
	part of the key happens to be the Objective-C name of a
	property exposed by the QTCaptureDevice that provides the name
	of the device to display.  The actual item selected on the
	screen is controlled by the <strong>Selected Object</strong>
	binding.  In this case, a new property, the
	SelectedVideoDevice property.  At this point, the
	NSPopUpButton will populate its contents using these bindings.
	Additionally, when the user selects a different item, the
	property bound to the Selected Object will be invoked with the
	new value.  Our code responds by configuring the
	QTCaptureSession accordingly.

	<p>Another interesting binding takes place with the recording
	button.  The recording button hasits Enabled property bound to
	the HasRecordingDevice C# property and has its Value bound to
	the C# Recording property.  When we change the video source in
	the popup, the button responds by either getting grayed out or
	becoming active.  Although this could have been done
	programmatically in response to the new value set in the
	SelectedVideoDevice property, the code takes advantage of the
	built-in notification system and instead reacts to changes to
	the SelectedVideoDevice automatically.

	<p>This is done by using
	the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/Concepts/DependentKeys.html">dependency
	keys feature</a> a feature of Key-Value Coding. It requires
	that the code exports a specially-named method which is
	prefixed with the string "keyPathsForValuesAffecting".  These
	methods are are meant to return an NSSet containing the names
	of the properties that depend on that particular property.  In
	our case this is:

<pre class="code-csharp">[Export]
public static NSSet keyPathsForValuesAffectingHasRecordingDevice ()
{
    return new NSSet ("SelectedVideoDevice", "SelectedAudioDevice");
}</pre>

	<p>Once that is done, the runtime knows that when either one
	of the SelectedVideoDevice or SelectedAudioDevice change, it
	has to query the value for HasRecordingDevice again.
