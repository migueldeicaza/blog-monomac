<h1>NSNumbers, NSValues, Dictionaries and Arrays</h1>

	<p>A couple of days
	ago, <a href="http://jacksonh.tumblr.com/">Jackson</a> pointed
	out that one of the samples in this blog could be further
	simplified if we took advantage of C#'s params arguments.  The
	sample in question was this code snippet from QTRecorder, used
	to return an NSSet:

	<pre class="code-csharp">
[Export]
public static NSSet keyPathsForValuesAffectingHasRecordingDevice ()
{
    return new NSSet (new string [] {"SelectedVideoDevice", "SelectedAudioDevice"});
}
</pre>

	<p>In the above example, we have to manually construct the
	string array, so that we can call the NSSet (string [] args)
	constructor.  Jackson correctly pointed out that the above
	could be simplified if we introduced an NSSet (params string
	[] args) constructor.  This lets the compiler do the work for
	us, so the sample above can be written like this instead:

<pre class="code-csharp">
[Export]
public static NSSet keyPathsForValuesAffectingHasRecordingDevice ()
{
    return new NSSet ("SelectedVideoDevice", "SelectedAudioDevice");
}
</pre>

	<p>This got me thinking about another possible improvement to
	the API.  In a number of places in the MonoMac/MonoTouch API
	it is necessary to pass numbers, strings, booleans, points,
	rectangles, affine transforms and 3D transforms in
	NSDictionary and NSArray objects.

	<p>Since Objective-C does not have language-assisted
	auto-boxing like C# does, programmers have to manually box
	those in either NSValue types or NSNumber types.  An NSNumber
	can contain booleans, 16, 32 and 64 bit integers and unsigned
	integers as well as floats and doubles.  NSValues are
	typically used to box points, rectangles, sizes and 2D and 3D
	affine transformations.

	<p>In a few of the current samples we have code like this:

<pre class="code-csharp">
var objects = new NSObject [] {&nbsp;
    new NSNumber (13),
    new NSNumber ((float) 0.5) };
var keys = new NSObject [] {
    new NSString ("speed"),
    new NSString ("volume") };
var dict = NSDictionary.FromObjectsAndKeys (objects, keys);
</pre>

	<p>The above clearly is too verbose for no good reason.  We
	have now introduced methods that take general purpose object
	[] arrays, containing regular C# data types and will do the
	automatic boxing:

<pre class="code-csharp">
var objects = new NSObject [] {&nbsp;13, 0.5 };
var keys = new NSObject [] {&nbsp;"speed", "volume" };
var dict = NSDictionary.FromObjectsAndKeys (objects, keys);
</pre>

	<p>The method that does the object to NSObject conversion is a
	convenience static method in the NSObject class, with the
	following signature:

<pre class="code-csharp">
public static NSObject FromObject (object obj);
</pre>

	<p>The function can be used to convert nulls, booleans,
	numbers, strings, IntPtrs, SizeF, RectangleF, PointF on both
	MonoMac and MonoTouch and in MonoTouch it additionally
	supports CGAffineTransform, CATransform3D and UIEdgeInsets.
