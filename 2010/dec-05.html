<h1>Error Reporting Pattern in MonoMac</h1>

	<p>When writing code that reports errors to the user, usually
	when I get back an NSError result, I use the following code
	snippet to show it:
	
	<pre class="code-csharp">if (err != null){
   NSAlert.WithError (err).BeginSheet (Window, delegate {
       // Any needed cleanup code can go here,
       // it is invoked when the Sheet goes away.
   });
   return;
}</pre>

	<p>The above creates an NSAlert object using the WithError
	factory method, and then invokes the BeginSheet method to
	present this modally to the user.  Usually you can put any
	cleanup code in the body of the provided delegate.
