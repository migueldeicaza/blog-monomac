<h1>MonoTouch for iOS 4.2 is out.</h1>

	<p>We have graduated
	our <a href="http://monotouch.net/Releases/MonoTouch_3/MonoTouch_3.2.2">MonoTouch
	3.2</a> into the stable channel and is now available for all
	of our MonoTouch users in the stable channel.  To update, just
	go to the Help menu on MonoDevelop, select the stable channel
	and check for updates.

	<p>In addition to adding support for the new APIs introduced
	in iOS 4.2 for the iPhone and the iPad in the core libraries,
	we have bound many more frameworks that our users have
	requested, in particular the horrifying Security framework API
	now has a nice C# binding that regular humans can consume.

	<p>Enjoy!
