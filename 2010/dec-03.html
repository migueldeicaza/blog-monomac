	<p>We are very happy with this release as this is the first
	time that MonoMac can be used to build real applications for
	OSX.  There are three major reasons for this:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Our API coverage for all core Mac APIs is in place.</li>
		<li>We have completed many of the gaps in the MonoMac
		engine.</li>
		<li>With our community, we have been <a title="MonoMac sample
		source code"
		href="https://github.com/mono/monomac/tree/master/samples/">porting
		various samples</a> that have helped us polish the API and
		make sure that it is natural and usable for C#
		programmers.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In addition to those fundamental changes, MonoDevelop now
	also sports a new NSDocument-based template for new projects
	which will come in very handy for many
	developers.

	<p>The major changes in MonoMac 0.4 from version 0.2 released
	in early November are:
	<ul>
	    <li>MacCore (code shared with MonoTouch):
	    <ul>

	            <li>NSMetadata support</li>
	            <li>Strongly typed NSRunLoop</li>

	<p>Michael Hutchinson has
	a <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2010/06/09/monomac_in_monodevelop">walk
	through on using MonoMac with MonoDevelop</a> that will get
	you up and running quickly.

	<p>We are still looking for contributors to help us bring more
	samples to MonoMac, create
	more <a href="https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/master/extras/MonoDevelop.MonoMac/MonoDevelop.MonoMac/templates/">MonoDevelop
	templates</a> and help us add more of the system libraries to
	MonoMac.  If you want to join us, check out
