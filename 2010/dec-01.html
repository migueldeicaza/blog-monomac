<h1>Improving upon dictionary bindings.</h1>

	<p>iOS and OSX expose many of their APIs as dictionaries.
	This means that instead of having properties or methods to
	configure a particular object, the configuration takes place
	by creating dictionaries that use some special keys with their
	associated values.  These APIs are not well suited for
	exploration from the IDE or from
	our <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/CsharpRepl">REPL</a>.
	The APIs typically look like this:

	<pre class="code-csharp">
CFStringRef keys[] = {
    kCTFontAttributeName,
    kCTForegroundColorAttributeName
};
CFTypeRef  bval[] = {
    cfListLineCTFontRef,
    CGColorGetConstantColor(kCGColorBlack)
},

attr = CFDictionaryCreate (kCFAllocatorDefault,
        (const void **) &amp;keys, (const void **) &amp;bval,
        sizeof(keys) / sizeof(keys[0]), &amp;kCFTypeDictionaryKeyCallBacks,
        &amp;kCFTypeDictionaryValueCallBacks);

astr = CFAttributedStringCreate(kCFAllocatorDefault, CFSTR("FFFFFF"), attr);[/sourcecode]
</pre>

	<p>To make the API more easy to discover through intellisense,
	and our assembly browser, we try to turn all of the
	Dictionary-based APIs into strongly typed classes that hide
	the dictionary, the names of the keys, and the types of the
	keys required.  The responsibility for getting the types
	right, to get the encoding working and to figure out which
	keys are valid or required in a dictionary are shifted from
	the programmer to the framework developers (in this case,
	MonoTouch and MonoMac developers).

	<p>What we typically do is we create a type that exposes all
	of the properties that might be supported by the dictionary,
	and we provide nullable version of them, for example, in the
	above case, Mono's implementation lives in the
	CFStringAttributes class, and the properties that we expose
	are these:

<pre class="code-csharp">
public class CFStringAttributes ()
{
    public CTFont Font { get; set; }
    public CGColor ForegroundColor { get; set; }
    [...]
}</pre>


	<p>Our users then instantiate configuration objects like this:

<pre class="code-csharp">var attrs = new CFStringAttributes () {
    Font = listLineCTFont,
    ForegroundColor = UIColor.Black.CGColor
};
var astr = new NSAttributedString ("FFFFFF"), attrs);</pre>


	<p>When you create your CFStringAttribute and start a new-line
	to enter properties, MonoDevelop knows the possible property
	values that you can initialize in the constructor, avoiding an
	entire trip to the documentation to figure out what is the key
	that you should use, the value and its encoding.  It is all
	kept on type-safe datatypes.

	<p>There is a second class of APIs, mostly in the Audio and
	Video APIs that exposes a whole set of properties behind
	fooGetProperty and fooSetProperty APIs.  Those APIs tend to be
	weakly typed, and take both a key, and depending on the key, a
	pointer to some value.  If you feed the wrong values to the
	program, your application could crash or corrupt its heap.  In
	these cases we have also walked away from exposing the
	low-level GetProperty/SetProperty methods, and instead exposed
	strongly-typed C# properties.

	<p>This is an example from the AudioFile API:

	<pre class="code-csharp">
        AudioFileGetProperty (
                audioFileID,
                kAudioFilePropertyPacketSizeUpperBound,
                &amp;propertySize,
                &amp;maxPacketSize
        );</pre>

	<p>In the above case, we are probing for the maximum packet
	size for the file.  The user has to find and pass the proper
	constant (kAudioFilePropertyPacketSizeUpperBound), the size of
	the object (this is a simple validation system to eliminate a
	certain class of memory corruption erors), the address of the
	variable that will get the result back, and then determine the
	proper type for the property (maxPacketSize).

	<P>What we have tried to do with MonoTouch/MonoMac is hide all
	of that complexity, and instead we expose strongly typed
	properties, in this case the equivalent code is:

<pre class="code-csharp">
var maxPacketSize = audioFile.PacketSizeUpperBound;
</pre>

	<p>The property is available as well for intellisense, so it
	is a lot simpler to see what is going on behind the scenes,
	shows up on the debugger window, on the interactive shell and
	means that scripting languages can access it without having to
	resort to reading C API documentation.
