	months I started to spend a lot of time on OSX and iOS due to
	our MonoTouch project.  <a title="MonoTouch"
	href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a> was our effort to
	blend seamlessly the iOS Objective-C APIs with the C# and ECMA
	CLI APIs.  This is probably one of our nicest bindings that we
	have ever done for a native API, and it build on the
	experience from previous attempts like CocoaSharp, MonoObjc
	and other bindings that were created for the Mac in the past
	seven years.

	<p>The MonoTouch design and binding patterns proved to be very
	useful, and Geoff Norton and myself decided to bring the same
	design and patterns from iOS to OSX.  This is how the
	new <a href="http://mono-project.com/MonoMac">MonoMac</a>
	bindings were created.  While MonoTouch is a proprietary and
	commercial produce, MonoMac is open source and licensed under
	the MIT X11 license.

	<p>Building MonoMac has been a very fun experience, as the
	scope of the APIs is larger and also as it seems to have
	filled a void in the space.  As the binding bootstraps, we are
	starting to see both users and contributors that have helped
	us move MonoMac faster by providing help with the bindings,
	polishing the API or writing samples that show how to use
	MonoMac.

	<p>My <a href="http://tirania.org/blog">personal blog</a> did
	not feel like the right place to share tips and tricks on iOS
	and OSX development for two main reasons: (a) tips and tricks
	were bound to be fairly boring for people interested in other
	topics that I blog about, and (b) because both of these
	operating environments are proprietary and I feel that sites
	that have historically aggregated my blog did so for its open
	source content.
