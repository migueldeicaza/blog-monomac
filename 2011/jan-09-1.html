<h1>New MonoMac Refresh!</h1>

	<p>As part of today's release of
	the <a href="http://tirania.org/monomac/archive/2011/Jan-09.html">Mono
	Packager for OSX</a> we have issued a new MonoMac refresh.

	<p>As we create more sample code, and start to write real
	applications with MonoMac, we have updated the API to be
	simpler, cleaner and more comprehensive.   This release is all
	about small incremental improvements to the MonoMac API.

	<p>As usual, we have updated the
	our <a href="http://mono.ximian.com/monomac-docs/">MonoMac API documentation
	MonoMac API documentation</a>.   If you are thinking about
	getting started with MonoMac, we strongly recommend you read
	our <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac">MonoMac</a>
	page for some useful links and tutorials.

<h3>Statistics</h3>

	<p>MonoMac 0.4 was installed by 263 developers, MonoMac 0.5 by
	369 developers.   Interesting considering that the holidays
	are a slow season:

<h3>Apps!</h3>

	<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/praeclarum">Frank
	Krueger</a> the creator
	of <a href="http://icircuitapp.com/">iCircuit</a> a real-time
	circuit emulator and editor for the iPad/iPhone has started a
	port of iCircuit to MacOS X using MonoMac:

	<p>Pretty amazing, considering that Frank only learned to use
	MonoMac yesterday (although he does have extensive MonoTouch
	experience). 
	
<h3>MacDoc Sample</h3>

	<p>During the holidays,
	I <a href="https://github.com/mono/monomac/tree/master/samples/macdoc">wrote
	MacDoc</a> a native front-end for the
	<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Monodoc">MonoDoc
	documentation engine</a>.   I also took Jonathan Pobst's
	<a href="https://github.com/jpobst/Kipunji">fabulous style
	sheets from Kipunji</a> to spice up the UI a little bit.

	<p>This is the result:

	<p>I still have to integrate the index and search features of
	MonoDoc into the UI, and I am struggling as to how to
	surface them in the UI.

	<p>The Index is supposed to have an alphabetical listing of
	classes, method, properties, fields, similar to the index at
	the end of a book.   I always found this to be very useful
	when developing with .NET.     The search functionality on the
	other hand uses Lucene to search in the documentation body.

	<p>At this point, I believe that I should add a tabbed
	widgets, and let the user pick between the tree view on the
	left and the index (with a new text-entry to do the
	incremental search).   But if the users uses the search on the
	toolbar, I should replace the tree and the index with a list
	of results.

	<p>Does the above make sense, or you think it is a terrible UI
	idea and completely unacceptable for OSX users?

	<p>I thought about merging the index and the body search, but
	it would render the index search a bit useless.   Anyways, if
	you are a Mac expert, please send feedback my way.
