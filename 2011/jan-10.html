<h1>Mono Packager and the Apple AppStore</h1>

	<p>We are happy to announce
	the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonomacPackager">Mono
	Packager for OSX</a>.

	<p>The Mono Packager for OSX makes it possible to create
	self-contained Mono applications that will run on OSX without
	requiring the Mono.framework to be previously installed on the
	system.  In combination with
	the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac">MonoMac
	project</a> you can build fully native MacOS X applications
	using your favorite .NET technologies.   From your choice of
	Mono/.NET languages, to your choice of Mono/.NET library. 

	<p>The packager can create both signed applications for
	distribution on the Mac AppStore, as well as creating
	installers for your software.

<h3>Mono on the Mac: Some Background</h3>

	<p>Mono on OSX has historically been distributed as an image
	that installed itself in /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework.
	Once Mono was installed, users could write code in 
	C# or their favorite .NET/Mono language and run the resulting
	executable.

	<p>The problem is that Mono.framework contains an entire
	development stack: compilers, GUI tools, command line tools,
	libraries, documentation which is convenient for developers,
	but most of the time, not very useful for end-users.

	<p>This meant that developers would typically ask users to
	first install the Mono.framework (a big download) and then
	they could install their applications.    

	<p>To work around that problem, some developers have chosen to
	manually embed Mono in their applications.  This has always
	been possible, but it was error-prone as developers would have
	to manually assemble Mono into their application bundle,
	configure Mono properly, and initialize the Mono runtime
	themselves.   Doable, but not pleasant. 

	<p>With today's release, we have taken the burden of creating
	self-contained Mono applications out of developer's hands and
	added it as a standard feature for developers to use.

<h3>The Mac AppStore</h3>

	<p>The Mac AppStore requires that applications submitted to it
	are completely self-contained and they do not depend on
	third-party frameworks to be installed on the system.   It
	also requires that your application and installer be signed.

	<p>Both of those features are supported in our MonoMac
	Packager.   Developers can now create Mac AppStore ready
	applications using MonoDevelop and MonoMac.   We have
	integrated the package creation, installer creation, and
	signing processes into our MonoDevelop IDE.

	<p>All that developers have to do is sign up for Apple's
	Mac developer program, get their distribution certificates,
	build a fabulous application and upload the application using
	the Application Loader to Apple.com.

<h3>Upcoming: Linking</h3>

	<p>In this version of the Mac bundler, we include all of the
	dependencies that your program takes.   For example, if you use
	the System.Xml library, the entire System.Xml library will be
	bundled with the application.

	<p>In our next release, we will add support
	for <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Linker">Mono's
	linker</a>, the same technology we used
	in <a href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a> to reduce the
	executable size.

	<p>When you choose to use use the linker, the granularity of
	distribute changes from the library-level to the type level.
	For example, if you only use one type from System.Xml, the
	linker will strip out all of the unused classes and generate a
	new System.Xml library that only contains the one type that
	you used.

	<p>We did not want to wait for the linker to be ready before
	shipping our packager, but we should have it ready soon.
	
<h3>MonoMac Refresh</h3>

	<p>As part of this release we have also issued a refresh to
	the MonoMac library and templates.

	<p>From now on, MonoMac binaries will default to be 4.0
	profile, allowing users to leverage all of the new features in
	the C# 4.0 language (like <tt>dynamic</tt>) as well as the new
	.NET 4.0 APIs that we introduced with Mono 2.8.

	<p>The updates to the MonoMac API are described
	in <a href="http://tirania.org/monomac/archive/2011/Jan-10-1.html">my
	other blog post</a>.
