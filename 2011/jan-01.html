<h1>CorePlot Bindings for MonoMac and MonoTouch</h1>

	<p>Happy New Year!

	<p>Today I wrote the MonoMac and MonoTouch bindings for the
	open source <a href="http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/">CorePlot</a>
	library. 

	<p>The bindings are available from
	the <a href="https://github.com/mono/monotouch-bindings">binding
	collection module</a> on GitHub and binaries for both
	MonoTouch and MonoMac are available there.
